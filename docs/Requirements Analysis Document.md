## Introduction

This Requirements Analysis document outlines the specifications for developing a Student Course Registration System. The system aims to facilitate administrators in managing student and course records and enable students to register for courses seamlessly. The application will feature a backend built with Java Spring Boot, interact with a MySQL database, and optionally include a React-based frontend interface.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to detail the functional and non-functional requirements for the Student Course Registration System. It serves as a blueprint for developers, stakeholders, and project managers to understand the system's objectives, features, and constraints, ensuring a comprehensive and aligned development process.

## Scope

The system will allow administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student and course records, manage student registrations for courses, and oversee course capacities. Students will be able to log in using unique credentials, register for courses with specific limitations, and manage their registrations. The system will ensure data integrity, secure authentication, and user-friendly interactions.

## Definitions and Acronyms

- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **API:** Application Programming Interface
- **UI/UX:** User Interface/User Experience
- **JPA:** Java Persistence API
- **ORM:** Object-Relational Mapping
- **SQL:** Structured Query Language
- **REST:** Representational State Transfer

## System Overview

The Student Course Registration System comprises two primary user roles: Administrators and Students. Administrators will manage the database of students and courses, while students will interact with the system to register for available courses. The backend will be developed using Java Spring Boot, interfacing with a MySQL database. An optional frontend can be developed using React to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Functional Requirements

### Database Design

- **Relational Database:** Utilize MySQL to design a normalized relational database.

- **Main Entities:**

    - **Student:**
        - Attributes:
            - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-incremented)
            - `name` (String, Not Null)
            - `email` (String, Not Null, Unique)
            - `special_key` (String, Auto-generated, Unique)

    - **Course:**
        - Attributes:
            - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-incremented)
            - `name` (String, Not Null)
            - `description` (Text)

- **Relationships:**
    - **Many-to-Many:** A student can register for multiple courses (up to 2), and a course can have multiple students (up to 30).
    - **Join Table:** `Student_Course` with attributes:
        - `student_id` (Foreign Key referencing Student)
        - `course_id` (Foreign Key referencing Course)

### Admin Features

1. **Login:**
    - **Functionality:** Admins can log in using their email and password.
    - **Validation:** Ensure credentials are correct and handle authentication securely.

2. **CRUD Operations on Students:**
    - **Create:** Add new student records with `id`, `name`, `email`, and auto-generated `special_key`.
    - **Read:** Retrieve student details.
    - **Update:** Modify existing student information.
    - **Delete:** Remove student records from the system.

3. **CRUD Operations on Courses:**
    - **Create:** Add new course records with `id`, `name`, and `description`.
    - **Read:** Retrieve course details.
    - **Update:** Modify existing course information.
    - **Delete:** Remove course records from the system.

4. **Retrieve All Students:**
    - **Functionality:** Get a list of all students along with the courses they are registered for.

5. **Retrieve All Courses:**
    - **Functionality:** Get a list of all courses along with the students registered in each course.

### Student Features

1. **Login:**
    - **Functionality:** Students log in using their unique `special_key` provided by the admin.
    - **Validation:** Ensure `special_key` is valid and handle authentication securely.

2. **Register for a Course:**
    - **Functionality:** Allow students to register for courses.
    - **Constraints:**
        - A student can register for a maximum of 2 courses.
        - A course cannot have more than 30 students.

3. **Cancel Registration:**
    - **Functionality:** Allow students to cancel their registration for a course.

### Authentication

1. **Separate Mechanisms:**
    - **Admins:** Authenticate using email and password.
    - **Students:** Authenticate using the `special_key`.

2. **Session Handling:**
    - Upon successful login, issue a session key to the user (admin or student).
    - Require the session key in the header of every subsequent request to authenticate the session.

### Backend Implementation

- **Framework:** Java Spring Boot.
- **API Development:** Develop RESTful APIs to handle all functionalities for both admins and students.
- **Database Interaction:** Use JPA/Hibernate for ORM to interact with the MySQL database.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive validation to enforce constraints (e.g., course capacity, maximum course registrations per student) and handle errors gracefully.
- **Logging:** Implement robust logging to capture key events, errors, and data processing steps for backend operations.

### Frontend Implementation (Optional)

- **Framework:** React.
- **Interface:** Develop a minimal user interface to interact with backend APIs, focusing primarily on backend functionalities if time is constrained.
